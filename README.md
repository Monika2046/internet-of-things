üõ∞Ô∏è Ultrasonic Sensor Simulation ‚Äì IoT Project
This project is a software-based simulation of an IoT system using an ultrasonic sensor, developed as part of an academic project. Instead of using physical hardware, the components were simulated and connected virtually on a laptop using software tools. The main purpose of this project is to demonstrate how ultrasonic sensors can be used for distance measurement in real-time IoT systems.

üìå Project Overview
Technology Used: IoT simulation (Software-based)

Sensor Simulated: Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)

Platform: Laptop (no physical hardware used)

Purpose: Measure distance and trigger actions based on object detection

Application Areas: Obstacle detection, parking systems, distance measurement, smart automation, etc.

üß∞ Tools & Technologies
IoT Simulation Software (e.g., Cisco Packet Tracer, Proteus, or any IoT simulator)

Arduino IDE / Code editor

Embedded C / Arduino Programming

Serial Monitor for Output Display

‚öôÔ∏è Features
Simulated Ultrasonic Sensor to detect object distance

Real-time output displayed on Serial Monitor or virtual interface

Customizable threshold distance to trigger alerts

Lightweight, runs entirely on a software-based simulation platform
